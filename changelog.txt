0.2.3
 * There are now shorter method calls
api.get_item_tooltip(29242)
api.get_item_tooltip(29242, :caching => false, :lang => 'fr_fr')

The old style still works too
api.get_item_tooltip(:item_id => 29242)

api.get_character_sheet("Smith")

The same applies for searches, instead of
api.search_characters(:search => "cake")
it is now possible to write
api.search_characters("cake")

 * The API is now more strict and will throw exceptions if the correct parameters are not provided.

 * For consistency, the API now throws errors whenever an item or character is not found from a get request.  Search requests still return empty arrays if nothing is found, but will return an exception if the correct search parameters are not provided.

 * More informative exception messages.
 * Caching is now on by default.
