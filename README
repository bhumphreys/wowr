Wowr
----

Ruby Library for the World of Warcraft Armory



Introduction
------------

Wowr is an API for accessing data in the World of Warcraft Armory. Using the XML data provided by the armory, it allows developers to query World of Warcraft items, characters, guilds and arena teams. It is designed to support developers that wish to add WoW information to their Ruby-powered site, as well as larger guild or portal sites for many users.



Usage
-----

When initialising the library, it is possible to set a number of parameters to be used as defaults in other API functions.

# all parameters optional
api = Wowr::API.new(:character_name => 'Foo',
                  :guild_name => 'Bar',
                  :realm => 'Baz',
                  :locale => :eu, # defaults to US
                  :caching => true) # defaults to false, default directory is 'cache/

# Character requests
my_char = api.get_character
char_boo = api.get_character(:character_name => 'Boo')
chars = api.search_characters(:search => 'Cake')

# Guild requests
guilds = api.search_guilds(:search => 'Cake')
cake_guild = api.get_guild(:guild_name => 'Cake', :realm => 'Silver Hand')

# Items
items = api.search_items(:search => 'Cake')
item_info = api.get_item_info(:item_id => 33924)
item_tooltip = api.get_item_tooltip(:item_id => 33924)

# Arena Teams
arena_teams = api.search_arena_teams(:search => 'Lemon')
arena_team = api.get_arena_team(:team_name => 'Lemon', :realm => 'Hakkar', :team_size => 5)

This API is under development, and is one of my first API projects, so I would greatly appreciate any feedback about it's usefulness or any requests for features/changes. Feel free to drop me a line at benhumphreys[at]gmail
